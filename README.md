# RT-DP
Radiation Therapy Disaster Preparedness (RT-DP) System

Ransomware is an increasing threat for continuous radiation treatment 
in fighting cancer. It also results in in data breaches against patient 
privacy. More and more cancer centres have suffered from Ransomware 
which results in downtime from weeks to months, together with patient 
information leaking to the public. RT-DP is a system planning for 
situations that caused the oncology information system fully offline, 
including ransomware attacks. In such a disater situation, RT-DP will 
help in bringing patients under treatment or patients with plans ready 
to continue their treatment while we are restoring the full functionality 
of the whole RT infrastructure. It can hence avoid the treatment gap, 
reduce the clinical impact to neighbour cancer centres.

At the current stage, RT-DP is working for Aria OIS system. The same idea 
should be applicable to other OIS.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Versioning is based on the OIS system
* _1.x: Based on Aria 16.x. Not tested but should be working for 13.x, 
15.x and 17.x._
* _2.x: Based on Aria 18.x. Working for v16.x too._

_Note: Latest 2.x should be the first choice for Aria v13.x -- v18.x._
