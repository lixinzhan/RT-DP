# RT-DP
Radiation Therapy Disaster Preparedness (RT-DP) System

Ransomware is an increasing threat for continuous radiation treatment in fighting cancer. It also results in in data breaches against patient privacy.
More and more cancer centres have suffered from Ransomware which results in downtime from weeks to months, together with patient information leaking to the public.
RT-DP is a system planning for situations that caused the oncology information system fully offline, including ransomware attacks. 
In such a dister situation, RT-DP will help in bringing patients under treatment or patients with plans ready to continue their treatment while we are restoring 
the full functionality of the whole RT infrastructure. It can hence avoid the treatment gap, reduce the clinical impact to neighbour cancer centres.

At the current stage, RT-DP is working for Aria OIS system. The same idea should be applicable to other OIS.

-------------------------------------------------------

## Versioning is based on the OIS system
* _1.x: Based on Aria 16.x. Not tested but should be working for 13.x, 15.x and 17.x too._
* _2.x: Based on Aria 18.x. Working for v16.x too_

_Note: Latest 2.x should be the first choice for Aria v13.x -- v18.x._
