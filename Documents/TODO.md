1. DB dump: copy DB dump and keep the option of reconstruct DB
2. Trajectory log: Backup trajectory log from I: drive every 15 min to an isolated isolated network for treatment records recovery later
3. Independant Communication Channel: this channel should be out of the hospital network, such as WhatsApp, Slack
4. Patrient Triage: Priority 1 -- Squamouse cell; 2 -- non-squamouse cell but chemo-red; 3 -- the rest
5. Plan QA: how?
6. QA Software: basic machine QA software, such as W-L
7. Prior agreement from patients for priotizing patient categories
8. Provincial Committee for RT emergency.
