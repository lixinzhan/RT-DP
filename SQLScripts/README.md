# SQL Scripts for Querying Aria DB

This folder contains all scripts used for querying Aria DB to retrieve patient information.

__Notes:__

1. Starting from v15, Aria Documents are organized by the quarter of year VA_DOCS$\\YYYYQ#. Before that, they are all in one folder VA_DOCS$
2. Please make sure to change `@v15upgrdate` in file `DocFileLocation.sql` to the correct Aria v15 upgrade date.
